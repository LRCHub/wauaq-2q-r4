[00:05.99] For you, I was a flame
[00:10.63] Love is a losing game
[00:16.20] Five story fire as you came
[00:21.96] Love is a losing game
[00:28.69] One I wished I never played
[00:34.18] Oh, what a mess we made
[00:40.59] And now, the final frame
[00:45.44] Love is a losing game
[00:55.94] 
[00:55.00] Played out by the band
[01:00.51] Love is a losing hand
[01:06.89] More than I could stand
[01:12.42] Love is a losing hand
[01:18.32] Self-professed, profound
[01:24.10] 'Til the chips were down
[01:30.03] Know you're a gambling man
[01:34.55] Love is a losing hand
[01:45.05] 
[01:44.60] Though I battle blind
[01:49.72] Love is a fate resigned
[01:56.22] Memories mar my mind
[02:01.15] Love is a fate resigned
[02:07.72] Over futile odds
[02:13.26] And laughed at by the gods
[02:19.30] And now, the final frame
[02:23.99] Love is a losing game
