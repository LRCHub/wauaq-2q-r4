Well, you got me right where you wanted me to be
Stuck in the middle of a hard place in Tennessee
Going 'round town tryna find out who knows your name

Margarita, hot chicken, strawberry wine
Looking for your lovin' to be mine, all mine

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

It's a shame
Playin' this lover's game

If a fire is what I was looking for to get me going
You lit it up, lit up, 'cause your burn definitely left me smokin'
Little Houdini, gone without a single trace

Margarita, hot chicken, strawberry wine
Looking for your lovin' to be mine, all mine

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

It's a shame
Playin' this lover's game

Sound the alarm
Get the Calvary
I let someone get the best me
(Oh yeah, yeah baby, oh yeah)
Margarita, hot chicken, strawberry wine
I'm looking for your lovin' to be mine, all mine

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

It's a shame
Playin' this lover's game
It's a shame
Playin' this lovers game

I got your number, baby
I got your number
I got your number, baby
I got your number, baby
I got your number, baby
